3418f956552,Welcome to the Medium API,Jamie Talbot,4533cec1ea76,12,"Medium is known for having a delightful editor, but it’s not what makes Medium special. What makes Medium special is the engaged network of readers and writers who are using the platform to push conversations and ideas forward by reacting and responding to them. We want your users to be a part of this network, where their writing can spark conversations and inspire, teach, or entertain people. We understand that everyone has their own approach to writing and preferred tools that help their ideas flow most freely from conception to page. Not everyone who would like to publish on Medium will want to do their writing on Medium.
To help your users participate in the Medium network, we’ve built a Publishing API, using OAuth2 for authentication, through which you can seamlessly publish to your users’ Medium profiles. The API supports Markdown and HTML content formats, canonical URLs for cross-posting, and the full range of licenses available on Medium. Full documentation can be found in our documentation Github repo.
You don’t have to build writing tools to create something interesting with the API. You could use our public domain support to publish documents that you think should be more widely available. Or create posts detailing crime statistics in your city. Or hook up an RSS feed to publish all the newly enacted laws in the United States. We’re incredibly excited to unlock your creativity and bring even more stories and ideas to our community.
To get started, head over to the Medium Applications page and setup your app. Once created, the easiest way to build on the platform is to use an SDK. There are currently three official SDKs, for Go, Python, and NodeJS. There is also a reference WordPress plugin that demonstrates PHP. If you run into any issues, file a bug in one of those repos or let us know by emailing developers@medium.com.
We’re excited to work with the development community to build a robust, stable, and predictable API. Respond to this post, tell us how you want to use Medium’s API, and help us shape its future.

A little over a month ago we launched the beta of the Medium API, and today we’re excited to announce that we’re opening access to everyone! This means any developer can now create an OAuth2 application and allow users to authenticate through Medium.
I would love to build a Chrome extension or a nice Slack plugin…. The new changes at Medium are exciting…
Love IFTTT recipes for Medium. Wish there was a recipe to automatically send bookmarked items to Pocket for reading later. IFTTT has a recipe to send recommended items to Pocket, but that is not as useful as most users send items to Pocket to read later.
Recently I’ve been working on swagger/OpenAPI and thought it would be good exercise to convert medium API doc to OpenAPI Specification. This allows developers to generate client SDK in different languages and jump-start their development.
I hope somebody will find this useful — here is the project link:",You don’t have to build writing tools to create something interesting with the API.,673,44,3,"Medium Update,Development,API"
68a1c3927e46,"In 1995, this astronomer predicted the Internet’s greatest failure",Rob Howard,e3a02b3ac0cc,12,"Twenty-two years ago, astronomer Clifford Stoll made a huge mistake. He challenged the popular notion that the Internet was a force for good, and he was ruthlessly mocked by just about everyone.
On the surface, you can see why his 1995 Newsweek column has been maligned for decades. Some of the problems he presented — like the challenge of taking secure online payments in a world before PayPal, and irrelevant search results before the days of Google — have been solved, or at the very least we’ve grown accustomed to their remaining flaws. That made his article easy fodder for mockery by technology columnists every time an anniversary rolled around.
The problem for the people who chose to troll Stoll, however, is that a lot of his predictions and criticisms of the web were spot on. Read this quote from 1995, and tell me it couldn’t be written (and praised) today:
This was written in reference to Usenet, an early Internet message board, but could apply to Twitter, Reddit, and countless other social platforms today without changing a single character. A few months ago, Ev Williams, the founder of Medium and co-founder of Twitter, said almost the exact same thing:
In the same article, Williams told The New York Times: “The Internet is broken.” If only someone had seen this coming.
As a scientist, Stoll had been using forms of the Internet since its inception in the ’70s. He wasn’t off-base in calling it a “wasteland of unfiltered data.” He was 20 years ahead of his time.
For all the progress and quality-of-life improvements we’ve seen with the rise of Internet-enabled technology, the Achilles’ heel is that we’re now universally plagued by information overload. That’s made us more anxious, more angry, more ideologically divided, and more confused about reality than ever before. Stoll dismisses the notion that “the freedom of digital networks will make government more democratic,” realizing that unfiltered, unlimited information leads not to a more knowledgeable and thoughtful populace, but to a cultural addiction to non-stop digital stimulation.
In recent years, Stoll has done his best to put the article behind him. He told The Los Angeles Times (in an uncharacteristically positive article about his predictions) that “the Internet has left me behind,” and in 2010 he contritely joined a comment thread devoted to mocking him, calling the article a “mistake” and a “howler.” Everyone appears to have missed the irony that a bunch of anonymous Internet commenters were trolling a renowned scientist, 15 years after the fact, for accurately predicting the proliferation of anonymous Internet trolls.
I’ll leave you with a prediction of my own. In another 22 years, we will look back on Stoll’s dystopian vision of the future of networked communication and wonder how he was so right and we were so wrong. Call him a curmudgeon if you’d like, but history will credit Stoll as an early whistle-blower of our collective descent into the anger, anxiety and overwhelm caused by the infinite, unfiltered information of the Internet age.

a716ddf8e1d9,9 popular online courses that are gone forever… and how you can still find them,Dhawal Shah,587ae1d1b9ba,33,"Since free online courses first took off back in late 2011, more than 7,000 online courses have been created by over 700 universities worldwide.
But almost a third of these courses are listed as “finished” on Class Central. This means that we don’t know when (or if) these courses will ever be offered again.
Last year, we lost a few hundred of these courses when Coursera shut down their old technology platform.
Some of these courses have come back, or even migrated to a different course platform. But many of the courses have been offline for years and, in many cases, course platforms have removed the description pages for the courses from their websites. It’s like they never existed. A few of these courses have hundreds of reviews on Class Central and were taken by hundreds of thousands of learners.
Luckily, Class Central has an almost complete history of all the courses that have ever been offered. I combed through all the finished courses and made a list of a few popular courses. Where possible, I will recommend an alternative source to get access to the course videos.
If you like to read articles or listen to podcasts about economics, you might know who Dan Ariely is. He is a Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University, and is often used as the subject matter “expert” in media. He is quite a popular figure — his TED talk has been watched by over seven million people, and he has written multiple New York Times bestsellers.
Back in March 2013, Dan Ariely also launched a hugely popular course on Coursera entitled A Beginner’s Guide to Irrational Behavior. The course page no longer exists on Coursera, but you can find it on Class Central here. It was last offered in March 2014 and has over 500 reviews on Class Central — and almost all of them are 5 star reviews. In fact it is still the highest rated course in psychology on Class Central.
You can read on Quora why the course was taken down.
Another Quora user has backed up the course materials. You can find week 1 — week 5 here and week 6 here. If you search on YouTube you will also find a number of talks given by Dan Ariely. These are not videos from the course, but there might be some overlap.
It was disappointing to see this edX course taken down. UC Berkeley’s CS188.1X is one of Class Central’s Top 50 online courses of all time, as well as the #2 highest rated course on our Artificial Intelligence subject page. We even published a 1,100 word in-depth review for this course. Here is what the reviewer (Mal Minhas) had to say:
According to Mal, CS188.1x was an extremely demanding and difficult course, but it was also rewarding. Here is a GIF of one of Mal’s project submissions.
You should seriously consider reading Mal’s entire review to learn about this amazing course that you will never get to experience.
Just kidding. The professors of the course have made all the course materials available on their website.
This is another highly popular psychology course. In fact, it’s the #3 rated psychology course on Class Central. Launched in August 2013, Social Psychology has been taken by more than half a million learners worldwide. The course once boasted the single largest course session in the world, with 250k learners enrolled. Even in the heyday of free online courses, this number was pretty impressive.
The instructor of the course, Scott Pious, is Professor of Psychology at the Department of Psychology, Wesleyan University. He is also the founder of the Social Psychology Network (SPN), the world’s largest online community dedicated to social psychology.
The course went down when Coursera shut down their old platform last year.
An earlier version of the article pointed to a different course uploaded to Academic Torrents. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find an alternative source for Social Psychology.
Update: Mohammad Yasser has uploaded Social Psychology videos to Google Drive. Thanks Mohammad Yasser.
Dr. Yuval Noah Harari is an Israeli historian and a tenured professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Like Dan Ariely, you might come across him in mainstream publications.
He is the author of a number of books, including the highly rated Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. According to Amazon Author Beta, which ranks authors, Dr. Yuval is the #3 author for history. Wouldn’t it be amazing to be able to take a course directly from such a popular and mainstream figure?
The last time you could do that was in August 2014, when the course was offered on Coursera. His course, A Brief History of Humankind, is another highly-rated course on Class Central that we might never see again. You can check out the syllabus by visiting the course page on Class Central. Lecture 17 is entitled “Lecture 17: The End of Homo Sapiens.”
You don’t have to break the law to get access to the course materials for this one. Dr, Yuval has uploaded the course on YouTube. here is the link to the playlist.
This course might as well be called Defence Against the Dark Arts. For some reason, there have been three iterations of the Natural Language Processing course on Coursera, and none of them are available right now. Here is the list of these three courses.
Each of these courses can be found in two places: YouTube and Academic Torrents. The advantage of Academic Torrents is that you can also download the supplementary course materials, like transcripts, PDFs, or PPTs.
This Princeton University course has an interesting history (hah!). It been offered on three different platforms. First it was offered on Coursera in September 2012 under the name A History of the World since 1300. In September 2014 it moved to NovoEd, and it was called Global History Lab. Finally, it showed up on edX in September 2016. Maybe Professor Adelman likes to offer this course every two years. The materials might have changed partially or completely between these iterations of the course.
Unfortunately, I could not find the course materials. If you can find it, leave a comment below. If you still have access to the edX iteration of the course, maybe you can create a playlist of the videos. EdX hosts all their videos on YouTube in unlisted mode. You can’t search for them, but if you have access to them then you can create a playlist and let us know in the comments below :)
Startup Engineering is a Stanford course that “Bridges the gap between academic computer science and production software engineering.”
It was offered once on Coursera, back in June 2013. The course is taught by Balaji S. Srinivasan; he was CTO and co-founder of Counsyl, a genomics startup that began in a Stanford dorm room and now tests ~4% of all U.S. births. Early this year he was also considered by the Trump administration to lead the FDA (yes, Balaji hates the FDA). Currently, he is a board member at VC firm A16Z and a CEO/co-founder at 21.co.
The course had another instructor, Dr. Vijay Pande, a professor at Stanford, but it looks like all the videos in the course feature Balaji.
You can find all the videos of the course in this playlist on YouTube.
I’m sure I missed a lot of courses. Do let me know in the comments if your favorite course has disappeared from the online course platforms.

f94ed9f0696e,Scraping Medium posts,Ellie Day,e80c0d5887c4,22,"Medium is a great tool for posting and discovering great content, but not so great for accessing it’s content elsewhere. Wanting to have my latest posts show up on my personal site, heyellieday, I decided to make a little web scraper that would automate the process of transforming my latest posts into Ruby objects, which I could then use in many places, such as a JSON API, running on Rails. Due to the way that Medium’s front end site is made, this proved to be easier than I thought.
Note: I’ll be covering the scraper itself in this post. Look for future posts for getting that data onto your site.
This code is written in Ruby and I used a Macbook Pro running OS X Yosemite and had my development environment set up already. If you need help getting set up for coding Ruby on a Macbook, here is a good link: How to Install Ruby on Rails (You can skip the Rails stuff for now).
In addition to plain old Ruby, I wrote this simple scraper with the help of a few gems:
You can install them like so in your terminal:
Good job! You are now ready to write this cool scraper.
Note: All the code is in a Gist at the end of this post. I would reccomend using that as I don’t think Medium’s code view is good for copying and pasting.
The code I’m about to walk through is my rough, first round go at it, so it’s by no means perfect but it get’s the job done!
So, let’s open up a text editor and make a new file called scraper.rb. We need to include the 4 gems we just installed at the top of our file:
I made a method called “ latest” that, using Mechanize and Nokigiri, visits my medium profile and assigns the entire <html> tag to html_doc:
html_doc is the whole page, so anything on it we can select and transform into a Ruby object. As I mentioned, this was easier than I thought because there is a <script> tag on the page that assigns all the values we need (and more) to a GLOBALS variable in Javascript.
Here is how I got the raw tag, which was the third script tag in the array the search returned:
The JS object I needed was within that tag so all I had to do was strip the extra characters on either end of the Nokogiri object using some fun Ruby methods:
This is kind of hacky, but what I’m doing is converting the Nokogiri tag to a string and using chomp to remove characters from the end of the string matching “// ]]></script>”. I then reverse the string and use chomp on the “front” of the string, this time matching to a reversed string, that if you look closely is an opening <script> tag and the GLOBALS variable I mentioned.
Note: The spacing of the front_string variable value is important, so I would suggest copying from the full code linked below, otherwise it might not chomp properly!
What we get is a perfect JSON string that we can parse into a nice Ruby object:
Simple right? We now have lots of values that we can pick through and get what ever we want. The following might look like a lot of code, but I’m mostly just transferring selected values from medium_blob, only including the ones I need. Here’s what I chose, making a new “final object” from different parts of medium_blob:
I can then call my method and pretty print the object using the Awesome Print gem:
Which returns the following:
As you can see, it’s all nice and structured to be used in many different ways! I ended up integrating this into a Rails app and having it output back into JSON that I can use on my site. You can check that out here, under “Latest Posts”.
Here is a link to the full file that I would recommend using, since I don’t thing Medium’s code editor is good for copying and pasting code: https://gist.github.com/heyellieday/3ea6eb38e87be51c8048
I hope this was of help and if you have questions, ping me on Twitter: @heyellieday",,9,3,3,"Coding,Medium,Ruby"
